**Vector Contrastive Learning (VCL)** is a new contrastive framework that learns *vector-based relationships* between features instead of binary “close/far” classification. It’s designed for **pixel-wise self-supervised pretraining**, especially in **medical vision** (2D/3D, multi-modal imaging).

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🔄 **Vector Regression instead of Binary Contrast**  
  Predict displacement vectors between pixel-wise features rather than classifying them as positive or negative.

- 🧩 **COVER Framework (COntrast in VEctor Regression)**  
  A unified optimization flow combining vector regression and distance modeling.

- 🌐 **Multi-Scale Vector Pyramid**  
  Learns consistent pixel-wise representation across different spatial resolutions.

- 🧬 **Strong Pixel-Level Representation**  
  Outperforms existing pixel-wise SSL methods across **8 tasks** and **4 medical imaging modalities**.
